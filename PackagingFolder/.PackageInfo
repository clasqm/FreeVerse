summary			"A notepad for Appointments, To-dos and Diary entries."

Description			"FreeVerse is an application in which you can enter your appointments, to-do's and diary entries. The entry area is completely free-form - if you like, you can just start typing in any way you please, so if you want to use this program to keep a record of sports scores or sexual conquests, feel free to do just that. Cut and Paste works by using the right-click button on your mouse or trackpad. However, the program also has features that let you enter the data in a more structured way.
