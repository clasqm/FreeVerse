data "FreeVerse is an application in which you can enter your appointments, to-do's and diary entries. The entry area is completely free-form - if you like, you can just start typing in any way you please, so if you want to use this program to keep a record of sports scores or sexual conquests, feel free to do just that. Cut and Paste works by using the right-click button on your mouse or trackpad. However, the program also has features that let you enter the data in a more structured way."

data "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS"
data "</h2>"
data " "
data "Well, there haven't been any yet, but these are some likely candidates:"
data " "
data "Q: Where is my data?"
data "A: /boot/home/config/settings/FreeVerse/data"
data " "
data "Q: Why text files? Why not use attributes?"
data "A: The current version of yab does not support extended attributes directly. I have to shell out to system() every time and it slows down things horribly."
data " "
data "Q: Can I set the date format to month-day-year?"
data "A: No. Maybe one day."
data " "
data "Q: I entered an appointment manually,but it is not showing up in the graphical representation on the right!"
data "A: And it never will, not automatically, anyway. Even assuming that you have formatted the appointment correctly, constantly monitoring the text field and auto-updating the graphical representation would slow down the program unacceptably. Navigate away from the day (e.g. by clicking on another day to the left) and then return to the current day and it will be updated."
data " "
data "Q: How can I sort my appointments?"
data "A: Cut and Paste using the right-click button on your mouse or trackpad. Even better, position your cursor carefully before you enter a new appointment.This is a low-priority enhancement."
data " "
data "Q: How can I move a To-Do to another date?"
data "A: There's not much point to a to-do list if you don't actually DO things ☺. But Cut and Paste is your friend."
data " "
data "<h2>"
